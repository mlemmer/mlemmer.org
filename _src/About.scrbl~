Morgan Lemmer-Webber is a PhD candidate in Art History at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Her research focuses on the social history of women in the ancient world and her dissertation explores the relationship between women and textile production in the Roman Empire.

She is interested in Digital Humanities and believes that DH researchers should have access to a basic toolkit of programming skills. To that end, she has co-developed a series of workshops to teach programming to humanities students in particular, and more broadly anyone who wants to learn programming but does't have a math or computer science background.

In conjunction with her Digital Humanities interests, she has become an advocate for free software in academia. Utilizing and building free software is the best way to contribute to the academic commons, and to allow for collaboration between projects and institutions.
